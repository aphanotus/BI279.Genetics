## Week 4: Recombinant DNA Technology and Gene Editing

- **Recombinant DNA Technology**: Techniques that create new combinations of DNA sequences by artificially joining DNA from different sources, often for cloning and studying specific DNA sequences.
- **Cloning (DNA Cloning)**: The process of producing large quantities of identical copies of a specific DNA molecule, enabling its manipulation for various research and commercial purposes.
- **Restriction Enzyme (Restriction Endonuclease)**: Bacterial enzymes that recognize and bind to specific nucleotide sequences (recognition sequences or restriction sites) on DNA and cleave both DNA strands within these sequences, acting as "molecular scissors".
- **Recognition Sequence (Restriction Site)**: A specific nucleotide sequence, often palindromic, where a restriction enzyme binds and cuts the DNA.
- **Cohesive Ends (Sticky Ends)**: Single-stranded overhanging ends generated when restriction enzymes make offset cuts in DNA, which can base-pair with complementary ends on other DNA fragments, facilitating the joining of DNA from different sources.
- **DNA Ligase**: An enzyme that forms phosphodiester bonds, sealing "nicks" in the DNA backbone to covalently join DNA fragments and create recombinant DNA molecules.
- **Cloning Vector**: A DNA molecule (e.g., plasmid, bacteriophage) that accepts DNA fragments and replicates these fragments when introduced into a host cell, thereby enabling DNA cloning.
- **Plasmid**: Extrachromosomal, circular, double-stranded DNA molecules found in bacteria that replicate independently from the bacterial chromosome and are commonly used as cloning vectors.
- **Transformation**: The process by which bacterial host cells take up foreign plasmid DNA.
- **Multiple Cloning Site (MCS)**: A region within a plasmid vector, also known as a polylinker, that has been engineered to contain a number of restriction sites for commonly used restriction enzymes, allowing for the insertion of various DNA fragments.
- **Selectable Marker Gene**: A gene carried by a vector (often an antibiotic resistance gene, like *ampR*, or a reporter gene like *lacZ*) that allows for the identification and selection of host cells that have successfully taken up the vector containing recombinant DNA.
- **Blue-White Screening**: A method used in cloning experiments to identify bacterial colonies containing recombinant plasmids (white colonies) from those with non-recombinant plasmids (blue colonies), typically by disrupting the *lacZ* gene with the inserted DNA and using the substrate X-gal.
- **Expression Vector**: A type of cloning vector specifically designed to ensure mRNA expression of a cloned gene, with the purpose of producing many copies of the gene's encoded protein in a host cell.
- **cDNA Library (Complementary DNA Library)**: A collection of DNA copies (cDNA) synthesized from mRNA molecules, representing only the genes that were actively expressed in a specific cell or tissue at a particular time.
- **Reverse Transcriptase**: An enzyme that uses an mRNA molecule as a template to synthesize a complementary DNA (cDNA) strand, a key step in creating cDNA libraries.
- **Genome Editing (Gene Editing)**: Techniques used to modify DNA sequences in the genome, demonstrating value in basic research and potential clinical applications.
- **CRISPR/Cas9**: A gene-editing technology that utilizes a guide RNA and the Cas9 endonuclease to make precise, targeted modifications to the genome, allowing for correction of errors, and turning genes on or off.
- **Cas9 (CRISPR-associated protein 9)**: An endonuclease enzyme component of the CRISPR/Cas9 system that creates a double-stranded break in DNA at a specific target sequence directed by the guide RNA.
- **Guide RNA (sgRNA)**: A synthetic single-strand RNA molecule that matches a desired target gene and directs the Cas9 enzyme to the precise location in the genomic DNA for cutting.
- **Protospacer Adjacent Motif (PAM)**: A short, specific DNA sequence (2-5 nucleotides long) located at the 3' end of the target DNA, which is essential for the Cas9 enzyme to cut the DNA.
- **Homology Directed Repair**: A DNA repair pathway that can be leveraged in gene editing, where a homologous piece of DNA is used as a template to precisely incorporate desired sequence changes after a double-stranded DNA break.
- **Human Germline Editing**: Genetic changes made to the germline (reproductive cells or early embryos) that would be heritable and passed down to future generations, raising significant ethical considerations.
- **Off-target Effects**: Unintended genetic modifications occurring at sites in the genome other than the desired target, representing a primary safety concern in genome editing.
