## Week 9: Gene interactions; sex effects

- **Lethal Alleles**: Mutations in essential genes that are not compatible with life, often causing death during embryonic development, although in principle lethal alleles can cause death at any life stage.
- **Essential Gene**: A gene whose functions are crucial for the development or survival of the organism.
- **Recessive Lethal Alleles**: Mutations where lethality requires two (homozygous) copies of the allele.
- **Dominant Lethal Alleles**: Alleles that cause death even in heterozygotes. They are only maintained in a population if they impact viability after reproductive maturity (e.g., Huntington's Disease which typically manifests in middle age).
- **Pleiotropy**: The phenomenon where one gene influences two or more seemingly unrelated phenotypic traits (a gene exhibiting this is called a pleiotropic gene).
- **Gene Interaction**: Occurs when genes at multiple loci collectively determine a single phenotype.
- **Epistasis**: A specific type of gene interaction where the phenotype of one locus masks or prevents the phenotypic expression of a second locus.
- **Epistatic Gene**: The gene whose alleles suppress or override the effect of a second gene.
- **Hypostatic Gene**: The gene whose expression is masked or hidden by the epistatic gene.
- **Recessive Epistasis**: Occurs when the homozygous recessive genotype (e.g., *aa*) at one locus masks the phenotype of the second locus, often resulting in a 9:3:4 phenotypic ratio.
- **Genetic Background**: The influence of numerous weak epistatic interactions (between multiple genes) that affect a single phenotype.
- **Genetic Suppression**: A type of mutation that makes the phenotype look more wild-type (less mutant) by overriding another mutation.
- **Genetic Enhancement**: A type of mutation that makes the phenotype more mutant (less wild type) by increasing the severity of another mutation.
Complementation
- **Complementation Analysis (Test)**: Crosses used to determine if two independent mutations causing a similar phenotype are alleles of the same gene.
- **Complementation**: Occurs when crossing two homozygous mutants yields a wild-type phenotype in the F1 progeny, indicating the mutations are in different genes.
- **Complementation Group**: A group of mutant strains that fail to complement one another; all members of the group are presumed to harbor mutations in the same gene.
- **Allelic Mutations**: Two mutations that cause a similar phenotype and reside in the same gene.
- **Maternal Effect Inheritance**: An inheritance pattern where the offspring’s phenotype is determined by the genotype of the mother, regardless of the offspring's own genotype.
- **Maternal mRNA**: Cytoplasmic mRNA loaded into the oocyte (egg cell) that quickly produces protein after fertilization, driving early embryonic phenotypes.
- **Sex-Limited Trait (Sex Limitation)**: A trait where the expression of the phenotype is restricted to only one sex. (Loci responsible for sex-limited traits may be linked to autosomes or sex chromosomes.)
- **Sex-Influenced Trait (Sex Influence)**: A trait where the phenotype is modulated or influenced by the sex of the individual. (Loci responsible for sex-influenced traits may be linked to autosomes or sex chromosomes.)
