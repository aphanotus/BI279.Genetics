## Week 3: Cellular DNA replication; telomeres; DNA sequencing; hybridization methods

- **DNA Polymerase III**: The main enzyme that synthesizes new DNA strands by adding nucleotides to the 3' end of a growing chain, using a template strand [Simons 105, Fowler et al. 68]. It also proofreads for accuracy.

- **Helicase**: An enzyme that unwinds the DNA double helix, breaking hydrogen bonds and separating the two strands to allow access for replication machinery, forming a replication fork.
- **Primer**: A short RNA molecule, synthesized by primase, that provides a free 3'-hydroxyl group for DNA polymerase to begin synthesizing a new DNA strand.
- **Replication Fork**: The Y-shaped structure formed when the DNA double helix unwinds during replication, where new DNA strands are synthesized.
- **Leading Strand**: During DNA replication, the new strand that is synthesized continuously in the 5' to 3' direction, moving towards the replication fork.
- **Lagging Strand**: During DNA replication, the new strand that is synthesized discontinuously in short fragments (Okazaki fragments) in the 5' to 3' direction, moving away from the replication fork.
- **Okazaki Fragments**: Short DNA segments synthesized discontinuously on the lagging strand during DNA replication.
- **DNA Ligase**: An enzyme that seals nicks in the phosphodiester backbone of DNA, for example, joining Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand.
- **Telomere**: Repetitive DNA sequences found at the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes, which protect the chromosome ends and do not code for a particular gene.
- **Telomerase**: An enzyme, active in germ and stem cells (and some cancer cells), that uses an internal RNA template to extend the 3' end of the parental DNA strand at telomeres, counteracting chromosome shortening during replication.
- **Chain-Termination DNA Sequencing (Sanger Sequencing)**: A historical DNA sequencing method, developed by Fred Sanger, that uses modified dideoxynucleotides (ddNTPs) to terminate DNA synthesis at specific bases, allowing for sequence determination by fragment length separation by electrophoresis.
- **Dideoxynucleotide (ddNTP)**: A modified deoxyribonucleotide that lacks a 3' hydroxyl group, causing it to act as a chain terminator when incorporated into a growing DNA strand by DNA polymerase during Sanger sequencing.
- **High-Throughput Sequencing** (Next-Generation Sequencing or NGS): A broad category of DNA sequencing technologies that enable rapid and cost-effective generation of massive amounts of DNA sequence data by performing millions of reactions in parallel. These systems typically produce short reads (50-400 bp) that are stitched together using software.
- **Sequencing by Synthesis**: A core technology in Illumina sequencing, where DNA sequence is determined by detecting fluorescently-labeled, reversible terminator nucleotides as they are incorporated one at a time into a growing DNA strand. After imaging, the fluorescent dye and terminator are enzymatically cleaved to allow the next incorporation.
- **Flow Cell**: A proprietary surface used in Illumina sequencing where fragmented DNA templates are immobilized, amplified into clonal clusters, and then sequenced in parallel.
- **Single-Molecule DNA Sequencing** (also called Naopore Sequencing, Third-Generation Sequencing or TGS): DNA sequencing methods that aim to sequence single molecules of DNA in real-time, often producing very long reads, such as Pacific Biosciences' PacBio SMRT or Oxford Nanopore technologies.
- **In Situ Hybridization** (ISH): A technique that uses enzymatically- or fluorescently-labeled probes to hybridize directly to specific mRNA sequences within cells, allowing for visualization of gene expression in the spatial context of a tissue.
- **Microarray**: A tool for analysis of biological molecules, such as DNA, RNA, or proteins, by arranging them in a specific pattern on a surface like a glass slide. Labeled samples are then added to detect and quantify specific molecular patterns through hybridization. These devices allow for the simultaneous, large-scale study of gene expression, genetic variations (like SNPs), and other biological processes, aiding in disease diagnosis, treatment development, and personalized medicine.

- **SNP array**: A type of microarray-based technology that simultaneously analyzes thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (common genetic variations) across an individual's genome. It works by hybridizing a sample's DNA to an array of specific DNA probes, allowing for the detection of genetic variations, copy number changes (gains or losses), and other genomic abnormalities for research and diagnostic purposes.
