- **Gene**: the basic physical and functional unit of heredity, made of a specific sequence of DNA that contains instructions for building proteins or, in some cases, for regulating other genes. Genes are located on chromosomes and act as a blueprint, passed from parents to offspring, to determine physical and functional traits.
- **Promoter**: A specific region of DNA located just before a gene that acts as a control switch for transcription, the process of making an RNA copy from a DNA sequence. It provides the binding site for RNA polymerase and transcription factors, which are proteins that together form the transcription initiation complex necessary to start copying the gene's genetic information into RNA. The promoter determines in which direction the gene is transcribed. Eukaryotic promoters contain a "core" for basal transcriptional machinery, including the TATA box, usually 25-30 nucleotides upstream of the transcription initiation site.
- **Enhancer**: A gene's regulatory region containing DNA sequences that control where and when genes are "turned on" to produce messenger RNA (mRNA). They are typically position and orientation independent, and can be located upstream, downstream, or within the introns of a gene.
- **Transcription Factors**: Proteins involved in regulating gene transcription. Some, called "basal transcription factors," are essential for RNA polymerase binding and function and are expressed in all living cells. Others bind to specific cis-regulatory DNA sequences in enhancers or silencers to regulate RNA polymerase activity and gene transcription.
- **Bioinformatics**: An interdisciplinary science that applies mathematics and computing technology to develop hardware and software for storing, sharing, comparing, and analyzing nucleic acid and protein sequence data. It involves the use of computer applications to organize and analyze data related to gene structure, sequence, expression, and protein function.
- **BLAST** (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool): A popular software application provided by [NCBI](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) for searching through DNA and protein sequence databases, such as GenBank, to find similarities between sequences.
- **[GenBank](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)**: One of the largest genomic databases, maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), serving as a publicly available database of DNA sequences that stores, shares, and provides access to sequence information.
- **Genome browser**: an interactive, graphical tool that allows scientists to visualize, search, and analyze large amounts of genomic data and annotations, such as genes, regulatory elements, and variations, at different scales and resolutions. These web-based applications enable researchers to zoom from a whole chromosome down to a single nucleotide to explore genome organization, interpret experimental data in a genomic context, and compare different genomes.
- **Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)**: A technique used to recover DNA fragments that are attached to DNA-binding proteins. When combined with sequencing (ChIP-Seq), it allows researchers to map binding sites for proteins like transcription factors across an entire genome.
- **DNase sensitivity assay**: a technique that identifies regions of open, accessible chromatin by exposing isolated cell nuclei to limited DNase I digestion. The enzyme DNase I preferentially cuts DNA in these accessible regions and these sites correlate with active regulatory elements like promoters and enhancers. The digested DNA fragments are then analyzed, often using high-throughput sequencing (**DNase-seq**), to map these open chromatin regions throughout the genome. 
- **GAL4/UAS System**: A powerful genetic tool developed for targeted gene expression, particularly in *Drosophila melanogaster*. GAL4 is a transcriptional activator protein, originally identified in yeast, that binds to UAS enhancer sequences in DNA and recruits transcription machinery to induce gene expression. UAS (Upstream Activating Sequence) is a DNA element, analogous to an enhancer, that contains GAL4 binding sites. Genes or dsRNA placed downstream of the UAS are only expressed when GAL4 is present and binds to UAS.
- **Semiconservative Replication**: The model of DNA replication proposed by Watson and Crick, where each strand of the original double-stranded DNA molecule serves as a template to build a new complementary strand. Early experiments confirmed this prediction.
- **Origin of Replication** (ori): Specific sites along a chromosome where DNA replication initiates. Eukaryotic chromosomes have hundreds of these sites to speed up replication.
- **Replication Fork**: The Y-shaped region where the double-stranded DNA is unwound and new DNA strands are synthesized during bidirectional DNA replication.
- **DNA Polymerase III** (DNA pol III): The main DNA synthesizing enzyme in replication. It reads the single DNA template strand in the 3′ to 5′ direction and builds a new complementary strand in the 5′ to 3′ direction, adding nucleotides to a free 3′ end. It also proofreads for accuracy.
- **Okazaki Fragments**: Short DNA nucleotide stretches synthesized discontinuously on the lagging strand during DNA replication. They are named after Reiji and Tsuneko Okazaki, who provided evidence for this discontinuous synthesis.
- **PCR** (Polymerase Chain Reaction): An in vitro laboratory technique used to make millions of copies of a specific DNA sequence through repeating cycles of DNA replication.
- **Taq**: A heat-stable DNA polymerase, originally isolated from *Thermus aquaticus*, that is crucial for PCR because it can withstand the high temperatures required for DNA denaturation without losing activity. 
- **Thermal Cycler**: An instrument used in PCR that heats and cools DNA samples to precise temperatures for specific durations, automating the denaturation, annealing, and extension steps of the reaction.
- **Denaturation**: The first step in a PCR cycle, where the double-stranded DNA template is heated to 95-100°C to break the hydrogen bonds and separate the strands, making them single-stranded.
- **Annealing**: The second step in a PCR cycle, where the temperature is cooled to 45-55°C, allowing short, single-stranded DNA primers to bind to their complementary sequences on the single-stranded DNA templates.
- **Extension**: The final step in a PCR cycle, occurring at around 75°C, where DNA polymerase reads the template strand and synthesizes a new complementary DNA strand by adding nucleotides to the 3′ end of the primers.
