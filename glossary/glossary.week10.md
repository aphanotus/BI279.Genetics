## Week 10: Sex chromosomes; recombination; mapping

- **Autosome**: Chromosomes present in the same number in males and females.
- **X-linkage genes**: Genes located on the X chromosome that exhibit inheritance patterns distinct from autosomal genes.
- **Y-linked Genes**: Genes located only on the Y chromosome, typically involved in male sex determination or male-limited traits.
- **Hemizygous**: Describes the genotype of a male (or any individual) possessing only one copy of a gene (e.g., all X-linked genes in human XY males).
- **Homogametic**: The sex that produces gametes carrying only one type of sex chromosome (e.g., human females, XX; bird males, ZZ).
- **Heterogametic**: The sex that produces gametes carrying two types of sex chromosomes (e.g., human males, XY; bird females, ZW).
- **Reciprocal Cross**: A pair of crosses used to test the influence of parental sex on offspring phenotypes; often shows different outcomes for sex-linked genes.
- **SRY Gene**: The sex-determining region of the Y-chromosome; a key sex-determination gene in mammals.
- **Pseudoautosomal Regions (PAR)**: Regions of homology shared between the X and Y chromosomes that allow them to pair during meiosis.
- **Zygote**: The fertilized egg; the single cell from which all body cells originate in sexually reproducing organisms.
- **Linked genes:** Genes located close enough together on the same chromosome that they tend to be inherited together during gamete formation.
- **Linkage:** The major exception to Mendel's concept of independent assortment, where alleles of loci located close together on the same chromosome tend to be inherited together.
- **Unlinked genes:** Genes that appear to segregate independently, either because they are on different chromosomes or are far apart on the same chromosome.
- **Syntenic** (noun: **synteny**): A term describing genes located on the same chromosome, regardless of whether they are completely or partially linked.
- **Recombination:** A process that generates new combinations of alleles in gametes that were not present in the gametes from the parental generation.
- **Crossing over:** A physical exchange of chromosome segments occurring between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes during prophase I of meiosis.
- **Chiasmata (sing. chiasma):** Intersections seen between synapsed homologous chromosomes in meiosis, representing points of genetic exchange.
- **Parental gametes (Noncrossover gametes):** Gametes retaining the original combinations of alleles present in the parents of the dihybrid.
- **Recombinant gametes (Crossover gametes):** Gametes possessing allele combinations different from those found in the parental generation, usually resulting from crossing over.
- **Recombination frequency:** The percentage of recombinant offspring resulting from a cross, used to estimate the distance between two genes.
- **Map unit (mu) / centiMorgan (cM):** Units of genetic distance where one unit equals 1 percent recombination between two genes or the occurrence of recombinant phenotypes in 1 percent of offspring.
- **Genetic map (Recombination map):** A map representing the linear order and relative distances (in mu or cM) of loci along a chromosome, based on recombination rates.
- **Maximum recombination frequency:** The maximum observed recombination frequency between two loci is 50%, at which point the genes appear unlinked.
- **Complete linkage:** The situation where two loci are so close together that no recombinants are observed.
- **Coupling (cis) configuration:** The arrangement of alleles where both mutant alleles are on one homologous chromosome, and both wild-type alleles are on the other.
- **Repulsion (trans) configuration:** The arrangement of alleles where one wild-type allele and one mutant allele are on one homologous chromosome, and the opposite is on the other.
- **Haplotype:** A block or group of genetic variants (such as **SNPs** or **microsatellites**) that tends to be inherited together as a unit.
- **Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs):** Variations affecting a single nucleotide base pair, widely used as markers to associate with a trait.
- **Two-point test cross:** A cross involving one parent heterozygous for two genes and a tester homozygous recessive for both, used to measure RF.
- **Trihybrid testcross (Three-point cross):** A single cross used to determine the order and distance among three potentially linked genes in one experiment.
- **Double crossovers (DCOs):** Two simultaneous and independent exchange events between nonsister chromatids in a single tetrad, typically causing an underestimation of distance when only outside markers are observed.
- **Interference:** The phenomenon where a crossover in one region inhibits the occurrence of another crossover in a nearby adjacent region of the chromosome.
- **Thomas H. Morgan:** American geneticist who developed fruit flies as a genetic model organism. Morgan led a large and productive research group that discovered X-linkage and concluded that linked genes are arranged linearly on chromosomes.
- **Nettie Stevens**: Morgan's student who discovered X and Y sex chromosomes in a beetle in 1905.
- **Alfred H. Sturtevant:** Morgan's student who first realized that recombination frequencies could be used to map the sequence and distance of linked genes.
- **Barbara McClintock**: performed experiments in the 1930s using maize (corn) that demonstrated crossing-over involves an actual physical exchange of chromosome segments between homologous chromosomes.
