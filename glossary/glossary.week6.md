## Week 6: Gene regulation

- **Mutation**: A heritable change in the DNA sequence when compared to a reference organism. Mutations are the source of genetic variation in a population and can be beneficial, harmful, or neutral.
- **Somatic Mutation**: A mutation occurring in a non-reproductive (somatic) cell that is passed on to daughter cells through mitosis but is not inherited by offspring. An individual with a somatic mutation is considered a **mosaic**.
- **Germline Mutation**: A mutation that occurs in germ cells (egg or sperm) and can be passed on to the next generation, resulting in the mutation being present in every cell of the offspring's body.
- **Point Mutation**: A mutation that affects a single point in the genome, such as a **base substitution** (changing one base for another) or an **indel** (insertion or deletion) of one or a few bases.
- **Silent Mutation**: A base substitution within a protein-coding sequence that does not change the amino acid sequence of the resulting polypeptide, due to the degeneracy of the genetic code.
- **Missense Mutation**: A base substitution that results in a change from a codon specifying one amino acid to a codon specifying a different amino acid.
- **Nonsense Mutation**: A base substitution that changes a codon specifying an amino acid into a **stop codon**, leading to the premature termination of translation and a truncated protein.
- **Frameshift Mutation**: A mutation caused by an insertion or deletion of a number of nucleotides that is not a multiple of three, which shifts the **reading frame** of the codons and alters all subsequent amino acids in the polypeptide chain.
- **Loss-of-Function Mutation**: A mutation that results in a partial or complete reduction in the function of the gene product. These are typically recessive.
- **Amorph (Null)**: A complete loss-of-function allele that produces no active product.
- **Hypomorph**: A partial loss-of-function allele that produces a reduced amount or a less active form of the product.
- **Gain-of-Function Mutation**: A mutation that causes the gene product to have a new or enhanced function. These mutations are often dominant.
- **Hypermorph**: An allele that produces more of the same active product than the wild-type allele.
- **Neomorph**: An allele that produces an active product with a new, different function not seen in the wild-type.
- **Antimorph (Dominant Negative)**: A rare allele that has a new activity which is dominant and acts in opposition to the normal wild-type function, often by interfering with the wild-type protein's activity.
- **Operon**: A single transcriptional unit found in prokaryotes that contains multiple, functionally related genes grouped together under the control of a single promoter. It produces a single **polycistronic mRNA**.
- **Lac Operon**: A well-studied *E. coli* operon that contains the genes required for lactose metabolism and is transcriptionally regulated by both a repressor (**LacI**) and an activator (**CAP**) in response to the presence of lactose and absence of glucose.
- **Operator**: A specific DNA sequence located near or overlapping a gene's promoter to which a repressor protein binds, thereby physically blocking transcription initiation.
- **Catabolite Activator Protein (CAP)**: A transcriptional activator that, when bound to **cyclic AMP (cAMP)** in low-glucose conditions, helps RNA polymerase bind to the *lac* promoter, thereby increasing transcription rates.
- **Enhancer**: A regulatory DNA sequence in eukaryotes that can be located far from the gene it regulates (upstream, downstream, or within an intron) and contains binding sites for activator and repressor proteins. DNA looping brings the enhancer into close proximity with the promoter.
- **Silencer**: A regulatory DNA sequence in eukaryotes that binds repressor proteins to decrease or block the transcription of a target gene.
- **GAL1**: A model system for eukaryotic gene regulation in yeast. Among other components *Gal1* is regulated by Gal80p, a regulatory protein that inhibits the transcription factor Gal4p by binding to and masking its activation domain when galactose is absent, thereby preventing transcription of  *GAL1*.
- **Epigenetics**: The study of heritable changes in gene expression and phenotype that occur without altering the underlying DNA sequence. These changes are often mediated by modifications to chromatin.
- **Chromatin Remodeling**: The dynamic process of altering chromatin structure to control the accessibility of DNA to regulatory proteins and transcription machinery. This can involve sliding or ejecting **nucleosomes**.
- **Histone Acetylation**: A reversible modification where acetyl groups are added to histone tails by **histone acetyltransferases (HATs)**. This generally weakens the DNA-histone interaction, creating a more open chromatin structure that is accessible for transcription.
- **DNA Methylation**: An epigenetic mark involving the addition of a methyl group to DNA, typically at cytosine bases in **CpG islands**. High levels of DNA methylation are often associated with transcriptional silencing.
- **Genomic Imprinting**: An epigenetic process that causes genes to be expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner. Either the maternal or paternal allele of an imprinted gene is silenced, typically by DNA methylation, so that only one copy is active.
- **microRNA (miRNA)**: A class of small non-coding RNA that plays a key role in post-transcriptional gene regulation by binding to complementary sequences on target mRNAs, leading to either their degradation or the blockage of their translation.
- **RNA Interference (RNAi)**: A biological process where small RNA molecules, such as miRNAs, specifically inhibit the expression of a target gene by degrading its mRNA or blocking translation. This mechanism is also used as a tool in reverse genetics.
