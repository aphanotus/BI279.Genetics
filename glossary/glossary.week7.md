## Week 7: microRNAs; RNA interference; mitosis; meiosis

- **microRNAs (miRNAs):** Naturally occurring regulatory RNAs encoded in the genome. They function to regulate target genes by reducing translation of their mRNAs.
- **dsRNAs (double-stranded RNAs):** Complementary RNA strands, including miRNAs and double-stranded RNA used experimentally in RNA interference (RNAi).
- **Dicer:** An enzyme that cuts double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) to produce single-stranded guide RNAs, typically 22 nucleotides long.
- **Argonaute (Ago) proteins:** Proteins that bind to the single-stranded guide RNAs produced by Dicer to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).
- **RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC):** The complex formed when guide RNAs bind to Argonaute (Ago) proteins.
- **RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP)**: An enzyme that creates a new complementary RNA using the RISC-bound messenger RNA (mRNA) as a template. This action results in more dsRNA, which serves to amplify the gene silencing effect. The RdRP pathway is part of the mechanism of microRNA (miRNA) action and RNA interference (RNAi).
- **RNA interference (RNAi):** The experimental use of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to regulate gene expression. RNAi can be used in experiments or therapeutics.  
- **Cell cycle:** The process during which a cell copies its genome and prepares for cell division.
- **G1 Phase:** A stage of the cell cycle dedicated to cell growth.
- **S Phase (Synthesis):** The stage of the cell cycle during which the genome is copied (DNA replication).
- **G2 Phase:** A stage of the cell cycle dedicated to cell growth, which cells undergoing meiosis do not usually have.
- **M Phase:** The stage that includes mitosis and cytokinesis.
- **Mitosis:** The process of dividing chromosomes among daughter cells. It separates duplicated copies of the genome (equatorial cell division) to generate new somatic cells.
- **Prophase:** The first stage of mitosis when DNA is condensed, the nuclear envelope is deconstructed, the spindle apparatus is formed, chromosomes are attached to spindle fibers and begin to be positioned in the center of the cell.
- **Metaphase:** A stage of mitosis during which chromosomes are lined up along the metaphase plate.
- **Anaphase:** A stage of mitosis during which the chromosomes are divided or pulled to the poles using microtubules.
- **Telophase:** The last stage of mitosis when the spindle is deconstructed, nuclear envelopes reform around the now-separated chromosomes.
- **Cytokinesis:** The process of separating the cytoplasm, which happens at the conclusion of M phase. While cytokinesis usually happens after nuclear division in animal cells, it is not universal.
- **Sister Chromatids:** The two identical double-stranded DNA molecules that make up a chromosome after S phase.
- **Meiosis:** Reductive cell division that produces cells with half of a diploid genome in preparation for sexual reproduction. It reduces the chromosome number through two cell divisions.
- **Meiosis I:** The first meiotic division, listed as a key term associated with reductional division.
- **Meiosis II:** The second meiotic division, listed as a key term associated with equational division.
- **Gametes:** The cells (egg or sperm) that fuse during sexual reproduction and contain half the number of chromosomes (haploid) as the adult organism.
- **Homologous chromosomes:** The copies of a chromosome present in a diploid cell (one from each parent); they are very similar but not identical. They may different in alleles or may have chromosomal structural variants.
- **Synapsis:** The pairing up of homologous chromosomes that occurs during prophase I of meiosis.
- **Bivalent:** A term related to the paired homologous chromosomes during meiosis.
- **Tetrad:** The structure composed of 2 pairs of sister chromatids. Homologous chromosomes within the tetrad separate during Anaphase I.
- **Crossing over:** The process that occurs during synapsis, where non-sister chromatids exchange genetic material, leading to recombination between linked loci.
- **Chiasma** (plural: **Chiasmata**): The cytologically observable regions of crossover between chromatids.
- **Polar bodies:** Cells produced during gamete maturation in females (ovum maturation).
- **Ploidy (n):** Indicates the number of chromosomes in a single, haploid copy of the genome, used with a multiplier (e.g., 2n for diploid).
- **Haploid (1n):** Cells that have only a single copy of each chromosome.
- **Diploid (2n):** Organisms or cells that have two copies of the genome.
