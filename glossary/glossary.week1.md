## Week 1: The genetic material; DNA structure; Genome structure

- **DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)**: The information storage system and genetic material in all living organisms, a double-stranded polymer composed of nucleotides with **adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine** as bases. Its structure was critical for understanding how genetic information is transmitted.
- **RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)**: Primarily functions in the retrieval of information from DNA and is involved in protein synthesis (e.g., **mRNA, tRNA, rRNA**). Some viruses use RNA as their genetic material.
- **Nucleotide**: The **monomer** building block of DNA and RNA, consisting of a **nitrogenous base**, a pentose (five-carbon) sugar, and one or more phosphate groups.
- **Nitrogenous Bases**: DNA contains **adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T)**. RNA contains **adenine (A), uracil (U), guanine (G), and cytosine (C)** (uracil replaces thymine). **Purines** (A, G) have a double-ring structure, while **Pyrimidines** (C, T, U) have a single-ring structure. Their sequence in nucleic acid polymers is what encodes biological information. 
- **5’ and 3’:** a DNA strand has polarity. One end has a 5’ phosphate, the other has a 3’ hydroxyl group. The numbers refer to which carbon atom on the sugar these chemical groups are bound to. The carbons are numbered from 1', which is bound to the nitrogenous base. 4' is bound to the oxygen that makes the sugar ring. All of the sugar carbons have "prime" in their name to distinguish them from numbering of atoms in the nitrogenous bases. 
- **Deoxyribose**: The **five-carbon sugar** found in DNA nucleotides, distinguished by a **hydrogen (-H) atom on its 2' carbon**.
- **Ribose**: The **five-carbon sugar** found in RNA nucleotides, distinguished by a **hydroxyl (-OH) group on its 2' carbon**.
- **Phosphate-Sugar Backbone**: The linear, alternating chain of phosphate groups and pentose sugars that forms the structural framework of a DNA or RNA strand.
- **Complementary Base Pairing (Chargaff's Rules)**: In DNA, **adenine (A) always pairs with thymine (T)**, and **guanine (G) always pairs with cytosine (C)**. This specific pairing, discovered by **Erwin Chargaff**, ensures that the two DNA strands are complementary to each other.
- **Major groove and Minor groove**: the two strands of a DNA double helix don’t turn around the central axis at equal distances from one another. They “bunch up” on one side, creating an empty space: the major groove. On the other side of the helix, the strands are closer, creating the minor groove.
- **Central Dogma**: A fundamental concept in molecular genetics, stating that genetic information flows from **DNA to RNA to protein**. This process involves transcription and translation.
- **Replication**: The **semi-conservative** process by which a DNA molecule is copied. Each original DNA strand serves as a **template for the synthesis of a new complementary daughter strand**, resulting in two identical DNA double helices and ensuring genetic information is passed to new cells or offspring.
- **Transcription**: The process of synthesizing an **RNA molecule** using genetic information from **one strand of DNA (the template strand)**. This step transfers genetic information from DNA to RNA.
- **Translation**: The process by which the genetic information encoded in **messenger RNA (mRNA)** is decoded on **ribosomes** to synthesize a specific sequence of **amino acids**, forming a **polypeptide (protein)**.
- **Mutation**: A **change in the chemical composition of DNA sequence**. Mutations are the ultimate source of **genetic variability** among organisms and can be passed down through generations, providing raw material for evolution.
- **Transformation**: A heritable genetic change in bacteria. **Frederick Griffith** first observed that a "transforming principle" from heat-killed virulent bacteria could make avirulent bacteria virulent. This was later determined to be DNA, leading support to the idea that DNA is the genetic material.
- **Hershey-Chase Experiment (The Blender Experiment)**: A series of 1952 experiments using **radioactively labeled bacteriophages (T2)**. **Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase** conclusively showed that **DNA, not protein**, is the genetic material that enters bacterial cells and directs viral reproduction.
- **Rosalind Franklin**: A chemist who utilized **X-ray diffraction methods** to produce high-quality images of DNA, such as "Photograph 51". Her detailed data were crucial for determining the **helical nature of DNA**, the placement of phosphates on the outside, and the dimensions of the molecule. 
- **James Watson and Francis Crick**: Scientists who, in 1953, proposed the correct double-helix model of DNA structure. Their model integrated existing knowledge, including **Erwin Chargaff's rules** and critical X-ray diffraction data from **Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins**.
- **Gene Density**: Refers to the proportion of a genome that consists of protein-coding sequences. Prokaryotic genomes typically have high gene density, while eukaryotic genomes (like the human genome) have a much lower gene density (less than 2% is protein-coding).
- **Repetitive elements**: Non-coding DNA sequences that are repeated many times throughout a genome. In eukaryotes, these sequences (such as SINEs and LINEs) can comprise a significant portion of the genome (about 50% in humans) and were once considered "junk" DNA, but are now known to have potential regulatory functions.
- **Antiparallel**: Describes the orientation of the two strands in a DNA double helix, where they run in opposite directions. Specifically, the 5′ carbon end of one strand faces the 3′ carbon end of its matching strand.
- **Hydrogen Bond**: A type of weak chemical bond that links the complementary nitrogenous bases together in pairs, holding the two antiparallel strands of the DNA double helix together. **Adenine (A) forms two hydrogen bonds with thymine (T)**, while **guanine (G) forms three hydrogen bonds with cytosine (C)**.
- **Purine**: A class of nitrogenous bases characterized by a **double carbon-nitrogen ring structure**. In DNA, the purines are **adenine (A) and guanine (G)**. Each base pair in DNA consists of one purine and one pyrimidine.
- **Pyrimidine**: A class of nitrogenous bases characterized by a **single carbon-nitrogen ring structure**. In DNA, the pyrimidines are **cytosine (C) and thymine (T)**. In RNA, uracil (U) replaces thymine. Each base pair in DNA consists of one purine and one pyrimidine.
- **Oligonucleotide**: DNA and RNA are polymers, which are long chains of smaller subunits called **monomers**. The monomers of DNA and RNA are **nucleotides**, which are linked together to form a **polynucleotide**. An oligonucleotide, is a *short* segment of these polynucleotide chains.

- **Genome**: The **entire genetic content** of a cell or organism, encompassing **all its DNA sequences**.
- **Genomics**: The **study of genomes**.
- **Chromosome**: A **long DNA molecule** among which an organism's genome is typically divided. Prokaryotes usually have a single circular chromosome, while eukaryotes have multiple linear chromosomes.
- **Plasmid**: **Additional, extra-chromosomal circular DNA molecules** found in bacteria, which are much smaller than the main bacterial chromosome and can carry genes (e.g., antibiotic resistance genes).
- **Ploidy**: Describes the **number of copies of each chromosome** an organism typically has in its genome.
- **Haploid (n)**: Describes a genome or cell that contains **one copy of each chromosome**, characteristic of prokaryotes and gametes (e.g., human sperm or egg cells contain n=23 chromosomes).
- **Diploid (2n)**: Describes an organism or cell in which **each chromosome is represented in two copies**, called homologs. Human somatic cells are diploid, with 2n=46 chromosomes.
- **Aneuploidy**: A condition where a cell or individual organism has an **extra or missing portion of the genome** (e.g., an extra or missing chromosome or part of a chromosome) compared to the expected number for its species.
- **Homologous Chromosomes (Homologs)**: Pairs of **similar, but not identical, chromosomes**; one inherited from the male parent and the other from the female parent. They contain the same genes at corresponding loci but may carry different alleles.
- **Chromatin**: The **complex of DNA and associated proteins** (primarily histones) that forms the dense material of eukaryotic chromosomes.
- **Histone Proteins**: A group of **basic proteins around which DNA is wound** in eukaryotic cells. They are essential for compacting long DNA molecules into organized chromatin structures, forming nucleosomes.
- **Nucleosome**: The **fundamental structural unit of chromatin**, consisting of approximately 147 base pairs of DNA wrapped around a core of eight histone proteins.
- **Euchromatin**: A type of **loosely packed chromatin** that tends to contain genes actively undergoing transcription (i.e., genes that are "on") and is accessible to the transcription machinery.
- **Heterochromatin**: A type of **densely compacted chromatin** that often contains many repetitive sequences and genes that are generally not transcribed (i.e., genes that are "off" or silenced).
- **Centromere**: A **constricted region on a chromosome** that serves as the attachment point for spindle microtubules during cell division, crucial for the proper segregation of chromosomes to daughter cells.
- **Telomere**: **Repetitive DNA sequences** located at the very ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes, which protect the chromosome ends from degradation and maintain their length during DNA replication.
- **Non-coding DNA**: DNA sequences that **do not encode protein**. In eukaryotes, these sequences constitute the vast majority of the genome (over 98% in humans) and include regulatory sequences and various types of repetitive DNA.
- **Transposable Element**: These are genetic elements that have the ability to move, or "jump," to different locations within the genome. They are believed to have played a significant role in genome evolution. SINEs (Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements) and LINEs (Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements) are described as ancient remnants of transposons. Although many of these elements are no longer mobile due to accumulated mutations, some still retain the necessary sequence information for movement. Because the movement and proliferation of these elements does not benefit their "host" genome, they are also described as "selfish" or "parasitic" genetic elements.
