## Week 13: Genetics and society

-  **Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs):** Organisms created by transforming cells with recombinant DNA, containing transgenes that impart new traits that may originate from another organism.
-  **Genetic Engineering:** The targeted addition of a foreign gene or genes (transgenes) into the genome of an organism, often to transfer traits across species barriers.
-  **Transgenes:** New genes inserted into a plant or organism during genetic engineering to confer a specific trait.
-  **Transformation:** The process of inserting a desired transgene construct into the cells of a recipient species.
-  **Gene Drive:** A strategy designed to increase the chances that a specific allele (or transgene) is inherited by a majority of an individual's offspring, enabling the allele to spread rapidly through a population and violating Mendel's rules of equal segregation.
-  **Nikolai Vavilov:** Russian biologist who championed Mendelian genetics, developed the idea of centers of plant domestication, and amassed a huge world seed bank to safeguard crop genetic diversity; he died in prison due to malnutrition after being targeted by Lysenko.
-  **Trofim Lysenko:** An uneducated Soviet scientist, elevated by Stalin, who rejected Mendelian genetics and promoted the idea of Lamarckian inheritance; he led a crusade to purge Mendelian geneticists from Soviet science.
- **Lysenkovshchina:** Refers to the political campaign championed by Trofim Lysenko that opposed Mendelian genetics (which he called "Western genetics") and purged geneticists from Soviet institutions.
- **Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics (Lamarckian Inheritance):** The discredited theory, promoted by Lysenko, that changes acquired by an organism due to environmental conditions (like his claim of vernalization) can be passed down to its offspring.
- **Eugenics:** Discredited beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population. First promoted by Francis Galton in the 1880s.
- **Personal Genomics:** The evaluation of an individual's genetic information, often through sequencing, which is rapidly becoming common in clinical settings.
- **Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD):** Genetic analysis of single cells removed from embryos created by *in vitro* fertilization (IVF) to screen for genetic diseases before implantation.
- **Genetic Privacy:** The need to ensure confidentiality and protection against unwanted use or disclosure of genetic information, which is a significant concern for individuals and their relatives.
- **Re-identification:** The risk that individuals (or their remote relatives) can be identified using their genomic information (even if de-identified), particularly when combined with publicly available databases or online searches.
- **Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act (GINA):** A US federal statute providing special protection against discrimination based on genetic information in employment and health insurance, though not covering life insurance.
- **Informed Consent:** The requirement that individuals understand the potential uses, risks, and benefits of sharing their genetic data for treatment or research purposes and provide their agreement.
- **Data Stewardship:** Core ethical principles (including transparency, data integrity, and security) urging those who hold large databases of genomic information to manage and protect that data responsibly.
- **Duty to Warn:** Potential legal and ethical obligations for healthcare providers to inform their patients (and sometimes their genetic relatives) of known genetic disease risks gleaned from genomic information.
- **Incidental Findings:** Findings revealed during genomic analysis that are not the primary target of diagnostic concern but may have clinical significance, raising questions about whether they must be disclosed to the patient.
- **Intellectual Property (IP) Rights:** Legal rights (patents, copyrights, trade secrets) asserted over genetic assets (such as databases or analytic methods) intended to create economic incentives for discovery and innovation.
- **Patent Law:** US law that grants exclusive rights to new processes or compositions of matter; it generally invalidates patents on naturally occurring genetic sequences (like isolated DNA), but upholds the patentability of synthesized molecules like cDNA.
- **Trade Secrets Law:** State commercial laws allowing businesses to protect items of economic importance by taking steps not to reveal them, but problematic in genomics due to lack of external validation and indefinite protection time.
- **Copyright Law:** Federal law protecting "creations" (works of authorship, compilations if original in arrangement); ideas or information gathered from elsewhere (like raw genetic data) are not copyrightable.
- **Myriad Genetics Case:** A landmark US Supreme Court case in 2013  that invalidated patents on naturally occurring BRCAl and BRCA2 gene sequences.
- **Somatic Gene Therapy:** Gene therapy focused on editing nonreproductive cells, affecting only the treated individual, and currently approved for clinical trials.
- **Germ-line Gene Editing (Therapy):** Editing genes in reproductive cells (sperm, egg) or embryos, resulting in changes that can be inherited by future generations; highly controversial and restricted in many countries.
- **23andMe:** A company offering **Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Genetic Testing** services, including analyses related to ancestry and disease risk.
