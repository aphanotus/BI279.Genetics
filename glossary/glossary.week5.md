## Week 5: Transcription; the Genetic code; Translation

- **Transcription**: The process by which the genetic information stored in a DNA template is synthesized into a complementary RNA molecule. It is the initial step in the flow of information from DNA to protein.
- **RNA Polymerase**: The enzyme that directs the synthesis of RNA based on the sequence of nucleotides in DNA template. 
- **sigma (Ïƒ) factor**: A protein subunit of RNA polymerase in *E. coli* and other bacteria that binds to DNA and is essential for recognizing promoter sequences to initiate transcription.
- **Template Strand**: The strand of the DNA double helix that is read by RNA polymerase to synthesize a complementary RNA transcript.
- **Coding Strand**: The DNA strand complementary to the template strand. Its sequence is identical to the mRNA transcript, except it contains thymine (T) instead of uracil (U).
- **Promoter**: A specific DNA sequence located in the 5' region (upstream) of a gene that the RNA polymerase recognizes and binds to in order to initiate transcription.
- **Consensus Sequences**: DNA sequences that are highly similar across different genes or organisms and are critical for biological processes. In bacterial promoters, key consensus sequences are the **-10 region** and the **-35 region**, which are recognized by the sigma factor.
- **Basal Transcription Factors**: Proteins required to initiate transcription for all genes transcribed by a specific RNA polymerase, such as RNA Polymerase II. In eukaryotes, they assemble at the **core promoter** along with the RNA polymerase to form what is collectively called the basal transcription machinery.
- **TATA Box**: A common DNA sequence element found within the **core promoter** of many eukaryotic genes transcribed by RNA Polymerase II, typically located about 30 base pairs upstream from the transcription start site. The consensus sequence for the TATA box is **TATA(T/A)A(T/A)** on the nontemplate strand. It serves as a binding site for the TATA-binding protein (TBP), which is a crucial step for initiating transcription.
- **TATA-binding protein (TBP)**: A protein that recognizes and binds to the **TATA box** sequence in the core promoter of eukaryotic genes. TBP is a component of the larger general transcription factor complex known as **TFIID**. The binding of TBP to the TATA box is one of the initial steps in the assembly of the basal transcription machinery at the promoter.
- **Mediator Complex**: A large protein complex in eukaryotes that facilitates the assembly of the transcription machinery on promoters. It functions as a scaffold, connecting the proteins bound to the core promoter with regulatory transcription factors bound to distal DNA elements like enhancers, often through the looping of DNA. The Mediator can be a target for both activator and repressor proteins to influence the rate of transcription.
- **Topologically Associated Domains (TADs)**: Regions of the genome that are organized into "chromosome neighborhoods" and are associated with each other in three-dimensional space. TADs are structured as loops of DNA that bring genes and their regulatory elements, such as enhancers and promoters, into close proximity. The boundaries of these domains are often marked by DNA elements called **insulators**. These insulators are bound by proteins like CTCF and function as barriers that block enhancers in one TAD from interacting with genes in a neighboring TAD. Insulators can also prevent the spread of chromatin modifications, allowing adjacent TADs to maintain different chromatin states.
- **Primary Transcript (pre-mRNA)**: The initial RNA molecule transcribed by RNA Polymerase II in eukaryotes before it undergoes processing.
- **5' Capping**: The addition of a modified guanine nucleotide to the 5' end of the pre-mRNA transcript. The cap is important for mRNA stability, export from the nucleus, and ribosome binding during translation.
- **Polyadenylation**: The addition of a string of 200-250 adenine nucleotides, known as the **poly-A tail**, to the 3' end of the pre-mRNA. This process is linked to the termination of transcription by RNA Polymerase II and contributes to mRNA stability and export.
- **Splicing**: A process in eukaryotes where non-coding sequences called **introns** are removed from the pre-mRNA, and the coding sequences, or **exons**, are joined together to form a mature mRNA.
- **Spliceosome**: A large molecular complex composed of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (**snRNPs**) that recognizes splice sites and catalyzes the removal of introns from eukaryotic pre-mRNA.
- **Alternative Splicing**: A regulated process in which different exons from a single pre-mRNA can be included or excluded, allowing a single gene to produce multiple distinct mRNAs and, consequently, different protein isoforms.
- **The Central Dogma**: The principle that describes the directional flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA (via transcription) and then to protein (via translation).
- **Triplet Code**: The fundamental nature of the genetic code, where genetic information is written in units of three ribonucleotide letters. Evidence for this came from **Francis Crick's** experiments with frameshift mutations.
- **Codon**: A three-nucleotide sequence within an mRNA molecule that specifies a particular amino acid or signals the termination of protein synthesis.
- **Degenerate Code**: A key feature of the genetic code, meaning that a given amino acid can be specified by more than one codon.
- **Unambiguous Code**: A feature of the genetic code where a single codon specifies only one amino acid.
- **Reading Frame**: The specific grouping of ribonucleotides read in groups of three (codons) during translation. The addition or deletion of nucleotides not in multiples of three results in a **frameshift mutation**, altering all subsequent codons.
- **Marshall Nirenberg and Heinrich Matthaei**: Scientists who deciphered the genetic code. Nirenberg and Matthaei first linked a specific codon (UUU) to an amino acid (phenylalanine) using a cell-free protein-synthesizing system and synthetic RNA homopolymers.
- **Har Gobind Khorana**: A researcher who synthesized long RNA molecules with repeating di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide sequences to confirm and clarify codon assignments.
- **Translation**: The process of protein synthesis where the sequence of codons in an mRNA molecule is decoded by a ribosome to produce a polypeptide chain with a specific sequence of amino acids.
- **Ribosome**: A complex cellular machine made of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins that serves as the site for translation. It has a large and a small subunit and contains three sites: the aminoacyl (A) site, the peptidyl (P) site, and the exit (E) site.
- **Transfer RNA (tRNA)**: A small RNA molecule that acts as an adaptor between mRNA and amino acids during translation. Each tRNA has an **anticodon** complementary to an mRNA codon and carries a specific amino acid.
- **Anticodon**: A sequence of three nucleotides in a tRNA molecule that base-pairs with a complementary codon in an mRNA molecule.
- **Charged tRNA (Aminoacyl-tRNA)**: A tRNA molecule to which its cognate (correct) amino acid has been enzymatically attached.
- **Wobble Hypothesis**: Proposed by Francis Crick, this idea suggests that the base-pairing rules are relaxed at the third position of the codon, allowing the anticodon of a single tRNA to recognize more than one codon.
- **Start (Initiator) Codon**: The first codon of an mRNA to be translated, which is almost always **AUG** and specifies the amino acid methionine.
- **Stop (Termination) Codon**: One of three codons (**UAA**, **UAG**, **UGA**) that do not specify an amino acid but instead signal for the termination of translation. 
- **Nonsense Mutation**: A mutation that creates a stop codon within a gene's coding sequence, which results in the premature termination of translation and the synthesis of an incomplete polypeptide.
- **Initiator tRNA**: A specialized transfer RNA (tRNA) that recognizes the start codon on an mRNA molecule to begin the process of protein synthesis, or translation. The initiator tRNA is distinct from the tRNA used for adding methionine at internal positions during elongation. In bacteria, the initiator tRNA carries a specially modified methionine called **formyl-methionine (f-Met)**.
- **Shine-Dalgarno Sequence**: A sequence in prokaryotic mRNA (consensus 5'-AGGAGG-3') that serves as a ribosome binding site, positioning the ribosome correctly at the start codon to initiate translation.
- **Kozak Sequence**: A consensus sequence in eukaryotic mRNA, that surrounds the start codon (AUG). The presence of this sequence increases the efficiency of translation initiation, as the scanning ribosome more readily recognizes and begins translation at an AUG embedded in this context. It was named after its discoverer, Marilyn Kozak.
- **Release Factors (RFs)**: Proteins that recognize the stop codons when they appear in the A-site of the ribosome. The binding of a release factor to the A-site promotes the release of the completed polypeptide chain from the peptidyl-tRNA located in the P-site. 
- **Ribosome Recycling Factor (RRF)**: Following the release of the polypeptide, this factor prompts the disassembly of the translation machinery, causing the mRNA, small ribosomal subunit, and large ribosomal subunit to separate. This allows the components to be recycled for another round of translation.
