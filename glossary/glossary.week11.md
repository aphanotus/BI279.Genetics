## Week 11: Advanced mapping techniques; haploid genetics; chromosomal abnormalities 

- **Molecular markers:** Short segments of DNA with known sequence and location that serve as landmarks for physical mapping.
- **Polymorphism:** A variation in DNA sequence present in more than 1% of the population, often not associated with disease.
- **SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism):** A single position (nucleotide) in the genome where different variants (alleles) are seen in different people.
- **RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism):** A polymorphic site where a sequence change creates or destroys a restriction enzyme cutting site.
- **Linkage disequilibrium:** Occurs when certain genetic variants co-occur more often than expected, suggesting they are inherited together due to linkage.
- **Microsatellites (Short tandem repeats, STRs):** Short repetitive DNA sequences (2–6 nucleotides) that vary in the number of repeats at a given site; used as molecular markers.
- **Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs):** Polymorphic sites where a sequence change creates or destroys a restriction enzyme cutting site.
- **Genome-wide association studies (GWAS):** A modern mapping technique comparing millions of sequence variants (usually **SNPs**) across the entire genome in case and control groups to find associations with a phenotype.
- **Reference panel:** A panel of DNA samples from people with known origins used for comparison to estimate a customer’s ethnicity.
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):** A statistical method frequently used to analyze and visualize genetic variation separating distinct populations.
- **Admixed:** Having ancestry from multiple populations.
- **Tetrad analysis:** A special mapping technique used for haploid eukaryotes where the meiotic products (the meiotic tetrad) are contained within a single structure.
- **Ascospore:** The haploid meiotic products (spores) in organisms like yeast or *Neurospora* contained within an ascus.
- **Ordered tetrad:** A linear arrangement of spores in the ascus that reflects the orientation of the four chromatids at metaphase I, allowing for mapping of genes relative to the centromere.
- **First-division segregation:** Segregation of alleles into separate nuclear areas after Meiosis I (a 4:4 pattern in ordered tetrads).
- **Second-division segregation:** Segregation of alleles that does not occur until Meiosis II (requires a crossover between the gene and the centromere).
- **Gene–centromere distance:** Map distance calculated in ordered tetrads using the formula: (percent of second-division tetrads) / 2.
- **Parental ditype (PD):** A tetrad containing only two types of meiotic products, both of which are of the parental type.
- **Nonparental ditype (NPD):** A tetrad containing only two types of meiotic products, both of which are of the non-parental (recombinant) type.
- **Tetratype (T):** A tetrad containing two parental types and two recombinant types.
- **Aneuploidy:** An organism gains or loses one or more chromosomes but not a complete set.
- **Monosomy:** The loss of one chromosome from an otherwise diploid genome (2n - 1).
- **Trisomy:** The gain of one extraneous chromosome (2n + 1).
- **Euploid:** An individual with the appropriate number of chromosomes for their species (e.g., 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes in humans).
- **Polyploidy:** The condition where more than two haploid sets of chromosomes are present (e.g., triploid, tetraploid).
- **Nondisjunction:** The failure of paired homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids to properly separate and migrate during meiosis (or mitosis).
- **Chromosomal aberrations (or mutations):** Changes that delete, add, or rearrange substantial portions of one or more chromosomes.
- **Cri-du-chat syndrome (Segmental deletion):** A syndrome resulting from the deletion of most of the small arm of chromosome 5, causing nervous system abnormalities and identifiable physical features.
- **Deletion (Deficiency):** A break in a chromosome resulting in a missing piece or portion of it being lost.
- **Duplication:** Any part of the genetic material is present more than once in the genome.
- **Inversion (Chromosome inversion):** A structural variation where a segment of a chromosome is turned around 180 degrees within the chromosome.
- **Paracentric inversion:** An inversion where the centromere is *not* part of the rearranged chromosome segment.
- **Pericentric inversion:** An inversion where the centromere *is* part of the inverted segment.
- **Translocation:** The movement of a chromosomal segment to a new location in the genome, or when a segment breaks and reattaches to a different, nonhomologous chromosome.
- **Reciprocal translocation:** An exchange of segments between two nonhomologous chromosomes resulting in a rearrangement but no gain or loss of genetic information.
- **Balancer chromosome:** Essential genetic tools used to maintain recessive deleterious mutations in stable stocks and prevent meiotic recombination.
- **Inversion breakpoints:** Chromosomal regions on balancers that prevent the recovery of recombinant chromosomes by inhibiting synapsis and producing aneuploid gametes upon single crossover.
