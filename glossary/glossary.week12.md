## Week 12: Cancer; meiotic drive

- **Oncogenesis**: The process by which cancer forms, typically beginning when one cell starts to proliferate faster than surrounding healthy tissue.
- **Tumor**: A mass of cells that grows much faster than surrounding healthy tissue.
- **Benign Tumor**: A tumor that stays localized to its original location, contained by an extracellular matrix capsule, and does not metastasize.
- **Malignant Tumor** (Cancer): A genetic disease characterized by abnormal cell proliferation and the potential to spread beyond original boundaries and metastasize.
- **Metastasis**: The process where cancer cells escape from the primary tumor, travel through the bloodstream, and form a secondary tumor at a distant site.
- **Proto-oncogene**: Genes that are positive regulators of the cell cycle, signaling for the cell to divide when conditions are appropriate.
- **Oncogene**: A gene resulting from a gain of function mutation in a proto-oncogene, causing the cell to divide uncontrollably regardless of whether conditions are appropriate.
- **Tumor Suppressor**: Genes/proteins that are negative regulators of the cell cycle, ensuring genome integrity by acting at checkpoints or repairing DNA.
- **p53**: A critical tumor suppressor protein that acts as a transcription factor to activate DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or senescence in response to DNA damage.
- **Apoptosis**: A controlled form of cell death that p53 can promote when a cell sustains high levels of DNA damage.
- **Two-hit hypothesis**: The idea that two mutations (one in each allele) are typically required in a single cell to inactivate a tumor suppressor gene and initiate cancer progression.
- **Sporadic Cancers**: Cancers that occur randomly in individuals with no family history of the disease, requiring all necessary mutations (hits) to be somatic.
- **Familial Cancers**: Cancers where individuals inherit a germline disease-associated variant in a tumor suppressor gene, giving every cell a head start toward oncogenesis.
- **Genomic Instability**: The rapid accumulation of mutations, often driven by rapid cell division or failure of DNA repair pathways, increasing the likelihood of acquiring additional oncogenic mutations.
- **Epigenetic Silencing**: The transcriptional inactivation of genes through epigenetic mechanisms, such as modification of histones or hypermethylation of DNA.
- **DNA Methylation**: The covalent modification of cytosines (typically at CpG sites) in DNA, which is usually associated with decreased transcription of nearby genes.
- **Histone Acetylation**: The addition of acetyl groups to lysine residues in histone tails by Histone Acetyl Transferases (HATs), which is associated with active transcription by loosening chromatin structure.
- **Histone Methyltransferases (HMTs)**: Enzymes that catalyze the transfer of methyl groups to selected lysine or arginine side chains in histone tails, with varied effects on transcription.
- **Segregation Distortion**: A deviation from Mendel's Rule of Equal Segregation, in which an allele or gene (often called a meiotic drive allele or a selfish gene) is able to manipulate the meiotic process to increase its representation among the resulting gametes above the level predicted by Mendelian inheritance (50%).
- **Meiotic Drive**: Genes that violate Mendel's rules of equal segregation.
- **Oxitec**: The biotech firm that engineered genetically modified mosquitoes for open-air tests in the U.S. in an effort to curb their numbers and halt disease spread.
